#### Explanation:
- **Name Property**: Returns the name of the plugin.
- **ApplyEffect Method**: 
  - Checks for required parameters `width` and `height`.
  - Simulates the resizing of the image data.
  - Uses the `ResizeImage` method to perform a dummy resize operation.
- **ResizeImage Method**: 
  - Uses `System.Drawing` to create a new resized image.
  - Sets high-quality resizing settings.
  - Converts the resized image back to a byte array.

This implementation simulates how the plugin would resize an image. You can replace the dummy logic with actual image processing code as needed. The rest of the framework should remain the same to handle various plugins and effects in a scalable and maintainable way.
